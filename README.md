The project was split by search/view pages and addinfo pages.

Shuangyu worked on search/view pages.
Yi worked on addinfo pages.

After finished our own pages, we meet together and assembly the links and test them together.

If possible, it could be more efficient when work on own pages, if we do it together because we do not need to spend long time to communicate bugs by texts.
